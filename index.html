    <h1>CSS INTERVIEW Q&A</h1>
    <h3>1. Difference between flex-direction as row and column.</h3>
    <pre>
        This is a CSS property based on the concept of the flexbox. Flex-direction property
        can be applied to the parent elements and then the child elements of this parent tag
        will be placed accordingly.
        The difference is when we apply flex-direction : row, child elements will be placed
        one after another in the same row (horizontally) and then the row or x-axis will be
        considered as the main axis, in this case the y-axis will be known as cross axis.
        </pre><br>
         
            <div class="container">
                <div class="flex-items"></div>
                <div class="flex-items"></div>
                <div class="flex-items"></div>
                </div><br>
<pre>   On the other hand if we apply flex-direction : column places the child elements in
    column(vertically) means every child element will be placed one after another in
    the same column, and then the y-axis will be considered as the main axis and
    x-axis will be known as cross axis.</pre> <br>
   
    <div class="container1">
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        </div><br>
       <h3> 2. Explain the Inline, Internal, and External Stylesheet.</h3>
<pre>In CSS, we have 3 different ways of writing styles for HTML elements:
o Inline
o Internal
o External
Inline styling gets applied directly to the element in the style attribute. This styling
is having the highest priority among all. But it is not advised to use this styling
much in projects</pre><br>
<h2 style="color: red; text-align:center;">Heading One</h2>
<p style="color: blue;">This is a paragraph</p>
<pre>
Internal styling gets written in the head tag of the HTML file. It will be written in
the style tag. The styling written in style tag will be applicable only in that HTML
file.
<h1>First Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
External Styling is done by creating a different CSS file with .css extension. This
file can be linked to any HTML file wherever the styling is required. The external
CSS file can be attached to the HTML file in the head tag in the link tag. This
styling is having the least priority but it is the most advised way of writing styling
in projects.
<h2>This is a heading</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</pre><br>
   <h3> 3. What does justify-content allow you to do?</h3>
    <pre>
The justify-content property is a sub-property of the Flex-box Module.
The justify-content property specifies how flex-items are distributed along the
main axis of their parent flex-container. If the flex-direction of the parent container
is row(default value) then the main axis will be the x-axis. If the flex-direction is a
column then the main axis will be the y-axis. This property has 6 different possible
values:
· flex-start (default)
· flex-end
· center
· space-around
· space-between
· space-evenly
· stretch

</pre><br>
<h3>4. Difference between Absolute and Relative Positioning?</h3>
<pre>
position: relative
● It is used when we need to position the HTML element relative to its normal
position.
● We can set top, right, bottom and left properties that will cause the element
to adjust away from the normal position
</pre><br>
<div class="box" id="box1"></div>
<div class="box" id="box2"></div>
<div class="box" id="box3"></div>
<div class="box" id="box4"></div>
<pre>
    position: absolute
● An element with position absolute will move according to the position of its
parent element.
● In the absence of the parent element, the HTML element will be placed
according to the body tag. In this case if you want to place the element at
any position based on the parent element then we need to give the position :
relative to parent element and then position : absolute to child element.
</pre>  <br>
<div class="box" id="box5"></div>
<div class="box" id="box6"></div>
<div class="box" id="box7"></div>
<div class="box" id="box8"></div>
<h3>5. What are grid-template-columns used for?</h3>
<pre>
Grid-template-columns property defines how many columns should be there in a
grid-container. The number of columns is determined by the number of values
defined in the space-separated list. It takes values in px, % and fraction (fr).
</pre><br>
<div class="container3">
<div class="item">This is Item-1</div>
<div class="item">This is Item-2</div>
<div class="item">This is Item-3</div>
<div class="item">This is Item-4</div>
<div class="item">This is Item-5</div>
<div class="item">This is Item-6</div>
</div><br>
<div class="container4">
    <div class="item">This is Item-1</div>
    <div class="item">This is Item-2</div>
    <div class="item">This is Item-3</div>
    <div class="item">This is Item-4</div>
    <div class="item">This is Item-5</div>
    <div class="item">This is Item-6</div>
    </div><br>
    <div class="container5">
        <div class="item">This is Item-1</div>
        <div class="item">This is Item-2</div>
        <div class="item">This is Item-3</div>
        <div class="item">This is Item-4</div>
        <div class="item">This is Item-5</div>
        <div class="item">This is Item-6</div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="container6">
            <div class="item">This is Item-1</div>
            <div class="item">This is Item-2</div>
            <div class="item">This is Item-3</div>
            <div class="item">This is Item-4</div>
            <div class="item">This is Item-5</div>
            <div class="item">This is Item-6</div>
            </div><br>
<h3>6. What is z-index in CSS?</h3>
<pre>
The z-index property determines the stack level of an HTML element. The “stack
level” refers to the elements position on the Z axis (as opposed to the X axis or Y
axis). Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower
index. If the z-index value of any element is positive then that element will be at
the top and element having negative value of z-index will be at the bottom.
Note :- z-index will only work on an element whose position property has been set
to absolute, relative and fixed.</pre><br>
<div id="boxA"></div>
<div id="boxB"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>7. What is the difference between Padding and Margin.</h3>
<pre>
These two properties are CSS properties that provide space or gap. Both margin
and padding targets the four sides of an element.
Margin: 
· Margin provides the space
between the border and nearby
elements. It is the space outside
the border.
· You can set margin values to be
negative if you want elements to
overlap.
· When you set margin values, the
element's size does not change,
only the space around it.
Padding:
· Padding provides the space
between the border and the
content of an element. It is the
space inside the border

· Padding values can only be
positive.

· When you set padding values, the
size of that element increases.
